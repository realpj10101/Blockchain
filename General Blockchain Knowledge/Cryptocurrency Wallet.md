## What is Cryptocurrency Wallet?

A crypto wallet is an application that functions as a wallet for your cryptocurrency. It is called a wallet because it is used similarly to a wallet you put cash and cards in. Instead of holding these physical items, it stores the passkeys you use to sign for your cryptocurrency transactions and provides the interface that lets you access your crypto.

Modern cryptocurrency wallets make the blockchain accessible to everyone. When cryptocurrency was first introduced, sending cryptocurrency was a manual task that required entering long keys. Today, the software does most of it for you.  

The first wallet was that of Bitcoin's developer, Satoshi Nakamoto. The second wallet belonged to Hal Finney, who corresponded with Nakamoto and reportedly was the first to run the Bitcoin client software wallet. Nakamoto sent him 10 bitcoins as a test, and the cryptocurrency craze began.

- A cryptocurrency wallet is a device or program that stores your cryptocurrency keys and allows you to access your coins.
- Wallets contain an address and the private keys needed to sign cryptocurrency transactions. Anyone who knows the private key can control the coins associated with that address.
- There are several different types of wallets, each with its own features and levels of security.
- Many cryptocurrency wallets can be used to store keys for different cryptocurrencies.

## Understanding Cryptocurrency Wallets

Cryptocurrency wallets are software applications on computers or mobile devices such as phones or tablets. They use an internet connection to access the blockchain network for the cryptocurrency you're using.

Cryptocurrencies are not "stored" anywhere—they are bits of data in a database, scattered all over it; the wallet finds all of the bits associated with your public address and sums up the amount for you in the app's interface.

Sending and receiving cryptocurrency is very easy using these applications. You can send or receive cryptocurrency from your wallet using various methods. Typically, you enter the recipient's wallet address, choose an amount to send, sign the transaction using your private key, add an amount to pay the transaction fee, and send it.

## Cryptocurrency Wallet Types

There are two main types of wallets: custodial and noncustodial. Custodial wallets (also called online wallets) are hosted by a third party that stores your keys for you. This could be a company that provides enterprise-level data security systems businesses use to preserve and secure data. Some [cryptocurrency exchanges](https://www.investopedia.com/best-crypto-exchanges-5071855) offer custodial wallets for their customers. Noncustodial wallets are wallets in which you take responsibility for securing your keys. This is the type that most cryptocurrency wallets on devices are.

There are two subcategories of wallets: [hot and cold](https://www.investopedia.com/hot-wallet-vs-cold-wallet-7098461). A hot wallet has a connection to the internet or to a device that has a connection, and a [cold wallet](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/030515/what-cold-storage-bitcoin.asp) has no connection. Lastly, there are three subcategories of wallets—software, hardware, and paper. Each of these types is considered either a hot or cold wallet.

So, you can have a noncustodial software hot wallet, a noncustodial hardware cold or [hot wallet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hot-wallet.asp), or a custodial hardware cold wallet. These are the most common types, but you may also encounter other combinations.

## Software Wallets

Software wallets include applications for desktops and mobile devices. These wallets are installed on a desktop or laptop computer and can access your cryptocurrency, make transactions, display your balance, and much more. Some software wallets also include additional functionality, such as exchange integration if you're using a wallet designed by a cryptocurrency exchange.

Many mobile wallets can facilitate quick payments in physical stores through [near-field communication](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/near-field-communication-nfc.asp) (NFC) or by scanning a [QR code](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quick-response-qr-code.asp). Mobile wallets tend to be compatible with iOS or Android devices. Trezor, Electrum, and Mycelium are examples of wallets that you can use. Software wallets are generally hot wallets.

## Hardware Wallets

Hardware wallets are the most popular type of wallet because you can store your private keys and remove them from your device. These devices might resemble a USB drive, and modern hardware wallets have several features.

You can make a cryptocurrency transaction on your computer or device by plugging in the hardware wallet. Most of them can sign cryptocurrency transactions automatically without requiring you to enter the key, circumventing a hacker's ability to log your keypresses or record your screen.

These devices often cost between $100 to $200. Ledger and Trezor are both well-known hardware wallets. Hardware wallets are generally considered cold wallets because they don't have an active connection until they are plugged in.

## Crypto Wallet Security

Wallet safety is essential, as cryptocurrencies are high-value targets for [hackers](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/032615/can-bitcoin-be-hacked.asp). Some safeguards include encrypting the wallet with a strong password, using two-factor authentication for exchanges, and storing any large amounts you have offline.

### Seed Words

Most modern wallets generate a twelve-word mnemonic seed phrase. An example phrase could be "airport bedroom impression sample reception protection road shirt..." which seems random but is created and linked to your keys by your wallet. You can use the phrase to restore the wallet if the device is lost or damaged. These words should be carefully stored in a safe place because anyone who finds them will be able to access your cryptocurrency.
