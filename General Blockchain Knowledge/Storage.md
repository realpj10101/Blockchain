Unlike a centralized server operated by a single company or organization, decentralized storage systems consist of a peer-to-peer network of user-operators who hold a portion of the overall data, creating a resilient file storage sharing system.

## Blockchain storage

### What is blockchain storage

Blockchain storage is a way of saving data in a decentralized network, which utilizes the unused hard disk space of users across the world to store files. The decentralized [infrastructure](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/definition/infrastructure) is an alternative to centralized [cloud storage](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/cloud-storage) and can solve many problems found in a centralized system.

### How blockchain storage works

[Blockchain] relies on distributed ledger technology ([DLT](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/distributed-ledger)). The DLT acts as a decentralized database of information about transactions between various parties. Operations fill the DLT in chronological order and are stored in the ledger as a series of blocks. An interconnected chain is formed between blocks with each one referring to the block before it, thus creating a blockchain.

In blockchain storage, files are first broken apart in a process called [sharding](https://www.techtarget.com/searchoracle/definition/sharding). Each shard is copied to [prevent loss of data](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/tip/8-blockchain-security-risks-to-weigh-before-adoption) should an error occur during transmission. The files are also [encrypted](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/encryption) with a private key that makes it impossible for it to be viewed by other nodes in the network. The replicated shards are distributed among decentralized nodes all over the world. The interactions are recorded in the blockchain ledger, allowing the system to confirm and synchronize the transactions across the nodes in the blockchain. Blockchain storage is designed to save these interactions forever and the data can never be changed.

1- **Sharding**: Files divided to smaller sections

2- **Replication**: Each shard has a copy so if one the them breaks or been lost on transaction - it restores 

3- **Distribution**: This encrypted shards distributed between thousands of nodes 

4- **Ledger Recording**: All of this exchanges(who saves which shard) registers on blockchain 

5- **Immutability**: When data registered. saves forever and it cannot be change


### Blockchain storage vs. cloud storage 

Blockchain storage is a potentially cheaper, more secure and more reliable alternative to centralized cloud storage.

Providers of centralized cloud storage prevent data loss by making copies of the data and storing it in different data centers. The large amount of data that is duplicated in this process can create excessive amounts of surplus information. Also, cloud storage requires enterprise-grade hardware for its [data centers](https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/definition/data-center). These factors can make centralized data storage significantly more expensive than blockchain storage.

By taking advantage of the empty space on users' devices across the world, blockchain storage can cut up to 90% of the cost of centralized cloud storage, proponents claim. [Individuals and businesses can profit](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/tip/5-tips-to-successfully-implement-blockchain-for-businesses) by renting out the unused space on their hard disks for others to use.
