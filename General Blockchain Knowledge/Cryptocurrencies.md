A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of exchange through a blockchain, which is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it.

## What is cryptocurrency?

A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Cryptocurrencies exist on decentralized networks that utilize blockchain technology—a distributed ledger secured by a network of computers.

A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central or governing authority. However, laws and policies set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have placed policies and standards that must be abided by institutions, such as [crypto exchanges](https://www.investopedia.com/best-crypto-exchanges-5071855) and [online brokerage firms](https://www.investopedia.com/best-online-brokers-4587872) that offer cryptocurrency.1
