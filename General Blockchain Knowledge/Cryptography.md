**Cryptography**, or **cryptology** (from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language"): [κρυπτός](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BA%CF%81%CF%85%CF%80%CF%84%CF%8C%CF%82#Ancient_Greek "wikt:κρυπτός"), [romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Ancient_Greek "Romanization of Ancient Greek"): _kryptós_ "hidden, secret"; and [γράφειν](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B3%CF%81%CE%AC%CF%86%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%BD#Ancient_Greek "wikt:γράφειν") _graphein_, "to write", or [-λογία](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%B3%CE%AF%CE%B1#Ancient_Greek "wikt:-λογία") _[-logia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-logy "-logy")_, "study", respectively, is the practice and study of techniques for [secure communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_communication "Secure communication") in the presence of [adversarial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversary_\(cryptography\) "Adversary (cryptography)") behavior More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing [protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol "Communication protocol") that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), [information security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security "Information security"), [electrical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering "Electrical engineering"), [digital signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing "Digital signal processing"), physics, and others. Core concepts related to [information security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security "Information security") ([data confidentiality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality "Confidentiality"), [data integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity "Data integrity"), [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication "Authentication"), and [non-repudiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-repudiation "Non-repudiation")) are also central to cryptography. Practical applications of cryptography include [electronic commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_commerce "Electronic commerce"), [chip-based payment cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_card#EMV "Smart card"), [digital currencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currencies "Digital currencies"), [computer passwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password "Password"), and [military communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_communications "Military communications").

Cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption "Encryption"), converting readable information ([plaintext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext "Plaintext")) to unintelligible [nonsense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsense "Nonsense") text ([ciphertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext "Ciphertext")), which can only be read by reversing the process ([decryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decryption "Decryption")). The sender of an encrypted (coded) message shares the decryption (decoding) technique only with the intended recipients to preclude access from adversaries. The cryptography literature [often uses the names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob "Alice and Bob") "Alice" (or "A") for the sender, "Bob" (or "B") for the intended recipient, and "Eve" (or "E") for the [eavesdropping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eavesdropping "Eavesdropping") adversary. Since the development of [rotor cipher machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotor_machine "Rotor machine") in [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") and the advent of computers in [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), cryptography methods have become increasingly complex and their applications more varied.

Modern cryptography is heavily based on [mathematical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_theory "Mathematical theory") and computer science practice; cryptographic [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") are designed around [computational hardness assumptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_hardness_assumption "Computational hardness assumption"), making such algorithms hard to break in actual practice by any adversary. While it is theoretically possible to break into a well-designed system, it is infeasible in actual practice to do so. Such schemes, if well designed, are therefore termed "computationally secure". Theoretical advances (e.g., improvements in [integer factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization "Integer factorization") algorithms) and faster computing technology require these designs to be continually reevaluated and, if necessary, adapted. [Information-theoretically secure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information-theoretic_security "Information-theoretic security") schemes that provably cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power, such as the [one-time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad "One-time pad"), are much more difficult to use in practice than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure schemes.

The growth of cryptographic technology has raised [a number of legal issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography_law "Cryptography law") in the [Information Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age "Information Age"). Cryptography's potential for use as a tool for espionage and [sedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedition "Sedition") has led many governments to classify it as a weapon and to limit or even prohibit its use and export. In some jurisdictions where the use of cryptography is legal, laws permit investigators to [compel the disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_disclosure_law "Key disclosure law") of [encryption keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_\(cryptography\) "Key (cryptography)") for documents relevant to an investigation. Cryptography also plays a major role in [digital rights management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management "Digital rights management") and [copyright infringement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement "Copyright infringement") disputes with regard to [digital media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media "Digital media").

## Terminology

Until modern times, cryptography referred almost exclusively to "encryption", which is the process of converting ordinary information (called [plaintext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext "Plaintext")) into an unintelligible form (called [ciphertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext "Ciphertext")). Decryption is the reverse, in other words, moving from the unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext. A [cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher "Cipher") (or cypher) is a pair of algorithms that carry out the encryption and the reversing decryption. The detailed operation of a cipher is controlled both by the algorithm and, in each instance, by a "key". The key is a secret (ideally known only to the communicants), usually a string of characters (ideally short so it can be remembered by the user), which is needed to decrypt the ciphertext. In formal mathematical terms, a "[cryptosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptosystem "Cryptosystem")" is the ordered list of elements of finite possible plaintexts, finite possible cyphertexts, finite possible keys, and the encryption and decryption algorithms that correspond to each key. Keys are important both formally and in actual practice, as ciphers without variable keys can be trivially broken with only the knowledge of the cipher used and are therefore useless (or even counter-productive) for most purposes. Historically, ciphers were often used directly for encryption or decryption without additional procedures such as [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication "Authentication") or integrity checks.

There are two main types of cryptosystems: [symmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm "Symmetric-key algorithm") and [asymmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography "Public-key cryptography"). In symmetric systems, the only ones known until the 1970s, the same secret key encrypts and decrypts a message. Data manipulation in symmetric systems is significantly faster than in asymmetric systems. Asymmetric systems use a "public key" to encrypt a message and a related "private key" to decrypt it. The advantage of asymmetric systems is that the public key can be freely published, allowing parties to establish secure communication without having a shared secret key. In practice, asymmetric systems are used to first exchange a secret key, and then secure communication proceeds via a more efficient symmetric system using that key.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography#cite_note-14) Examples of asymmetric systems include [Diffie–Hellman key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange "Diffie–Hellman key exchange"), RSA ([Rivest–Shamir–Adleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_\(cryptosystem\) "RSA (cryptosystem)")), ECC ([Elliptic Curve Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Cryptography "Elliptic Curve Cryptography")), and [Post-quantum cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography "Post-quantum cryptography"). Secure symmetric algorithms include the commonly used AES ([Advanced Encryption Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard "Advanced Encryption Standard")) which replaced the older DES ([Data Encryption Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard "Data Encryption Standard")).[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography#cite_note-15) Insecure symmetric algorithms include children's language tangling schemes such as [Pig Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin "Pig Latin") or other [cant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cant_\(language\) "Cant (language)"), and all historical cryptographic schemes, however seriously intended, prior to the invention of the [one-time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad "One-time pad") early in the 20th century.

In [colloquial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloquial "Colloquial") use, the term "[code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_\(cryptography\) "Code (cryptography)")" is often used to mean any method of encryption or concealment of meaning. However, in cryptography, code has a more specific meaning: the replacement of a unit of plaintext (i.e., a meaningful word or phrase) with a [code word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_word_\(communication\) "Code word (communication)") (for example, "wallaby" replaces "attack at dawn"). A cypher, in contrast, is a scheme for changing or substituting an element below such a level (a letter, a syllable, or a pair of letters, etc.) to produce a cyphertext.

[Cryptanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis "Cryptanalysis") is the term used for the study of methods for obtaining the meaning of encrypted information without access to the key normally required to do so; i.e., it is the study of how to "crack" encryption algorithms or their implementations.

Some use the terms "cryptography" and "cryptology" interchangeably in English while others (including US military practice generally) use "cryptography" to refer specifically to the use and practice of cryptographic techniques and "cryptology" to refer to the combined study of cryptography and cryptanalysis. English is more flexible than several other languages in which "cryptology" (done by cryptologists) is always used in the second sense above. [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC_\(identifier\) "RFC (identifier)") [2828](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2828) advises that [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography "Steganography") is sometimes included in cryptology.

The study of characteristics of languages that have some application in cryptography or cryptology (e.g. frequency data, letter combinations, universal patterns, etc.) is called [cryptolinguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cryptolinguistics&action=edit&redlink=1 "Cryptolinguistics (page does not exist)"). Cryptolingusitics is especially used in military intelligence applications for deciphering foreign communications.

## History

Before the modern era, cryptography focused on message confidentiality (i.e., encryption)—conversion of [messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information "Information") from a comprehensible form into an incomprehensible one and back again at the other end, rendering it unreadable by interceptors or [eavesdroppers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eavesdropper "Eavesdropper") without secret knowledge (namely the key needed for decryption of that message). Encryption attempted to ensure [secrecy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secrecy "Secrecy") in communication, such as those of [spies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy "Spy"), military leaders, and diplomats. In recent decades, the field has expanded beyond confidentiality concerns to include techniques for message integrity checking, sender/receiver identity authentication, [digital signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature "Digital signature"), [interactive proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_proof_system "Interactive proof system") and [secure computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_multiparty_computation "Secure multiparty computation"), among others.

## Classic cryptography

The main classical cipher types are [transposition ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher "Transposition cipher"), which rearrange the order of letters in a message (e.g., 'hello world' becomes 'ehlol owrdl' in a trivially simple rearrangement scheme), and [substitution ciphers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher "Substitution cipher"), which systematically replace letters or groups of letters with other letters or groups of letters (e.g., 'fly at once' becomes 'gmz bu podf' by replacing each letter with the one following it in the [Latin alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet "Latin alphabet")).[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography#cite_note-22) Simple versions of either have never offered much confidentiality from enterprising opponents. An early substitution cipher was the [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher "Caesar cipher"), in which each letter in the plaintext was replaced by a letter three positions further down the alphabet.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography#cite_note-23) [Suetonius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suetonius "Suetonius") reports that [Julius Caesar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar "Julius Caesar") used it with a shift of three to communicate with his generals. [Atbash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atbash "Atbash") is an example of an early Hebrew cipher. The earliest known use of cryptography is some carved ciphertext on stone in [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt "Egypt") (c. 1900 BCE), but this may have been done for the amusement of literate observers rather than as a way of concealing information.

In India, the 2000-year-old _[Kama Sutra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kama_Sutra "Kama Sutra")_ of [Vātsyāyana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C4%81tsy%C4%81yana "Vātsyāyana") speaks of two different kinds of ciphers called Kautiliyam and Mulavediya. In the Kautiliyam, the cipher letter substitutions are based on phonetic relations, such as vowels becoming consonants. In the Mulavediya, the cipher alphabet consists of pairing letters and using the reciprocal ones.

In [Sassanid Persia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sassanid_Persia "Sassanid Persia"), there were two secret scripts, according to the Muslim author [Ibn al-Nadim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_al-Nadim "Ibn al-Nadim"): the _šāh-dabīrīya_ (literally "King's script") which was used for official correspondence, and the _rāz-saharīya_ which was used to communicate secret messages with other countries.

[David Kahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kahn_\(writer\) "David Kahn (writer)") notes in _[The Codebreakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Codebreakers "The Codebreakers")_ that modern cryptology originated among the [Arabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs "Arabs"), the first people to systematically document cryptanalytic methods. [Al-Khalil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Khalil_ibn_Ahmad_al-Farahidi "Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi") (717–786) wrote the _Book of Cryptographic Messages_, which contains the first use of [permutations and combinations](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/permutation "wikt:permutation") to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels.

Ciphertexts produced by a [classical cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_cipher "Classical cipher") (and some modern ciphers) will reveal statistical information about the plaintext, and that information can often be used to break the cipher. After the discovery of [frequency analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis "Frequency analysis"), nearly all such ciphers could be broken by an informed attacker.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography#cite_note-28) Such classical ciphers still enjoy popularity today, though mostly as [puzzles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puzzle "Puzzle") (see [cryptogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptogram "Cryptogram")). The [Arab mathematician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_in_medieval_Islam "Mathematics in medieval Islam") and [polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath "Polymath") Al-Kindi wrote a book on cryptography entitled _Risalah fi Istikhraj al-Mu'amma_ (_Manuscript for the Deciphering Cryptographic Messages_), which described the first known use of frequency analysis cryptanalysis techniques.

Language letter frequencies may offer little help for some extended historical encryption techniques such as [homophonic cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher#Homophonic "Substitution cipher") that tend to flatten the frequency distribution. For those ciphers, language letter group (or n-gram) frequencies may provide an attack.

Essentially all ciphers remained vulnerable to cryptanalysis using the frequency analysis technique until the development of the [polyalphabetic cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyalphabetic_cipher "Polyalphabetic cipher"), most clearly by [Leon Battista Alberti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Battista_Alberti "Leon Battista Alberti") around the year 1467, though there is some indication that it was already known to Al-Kindi.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography#cite_note-Al-Kadi-1992-30) Alberti's innovation was to use different ciphers (i.e., substitution alphabets) for various parts of a message (perhaps for each successive plaintext letter at the limit). He also invented what was probably the first automatic [cipher device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberti_Cipher_Disk "Alberti Cipher Disk"), a wheel that implemented a partial realization of his invention. In the [Vigenère cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher "Vigenère cipher"), a [polyalphabetic cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyalphabetic_cipher "Polyalphabetic cipher"), encryption uses a _key word_, which controls letter substitution depending on which letter of the key word is used. In the mid-19th century [Charles Babbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage "Charles Babbage") showed that the Vigenère cipher was vulnerable to [Kasiski examination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasiski_examination "Kasiski examination"), but this was first published about ten years later by [Friedrich Kasiski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Kasiski "Friedrich Kasiski").

Although frequency analysis can be a powerful and general technique against many ciphers, encryption has still often been effective in practice, as many a would-be cryptanalyst was unaware of the technique. Breaking a message without using frequency analysis essentially required knowledge of the cipher used and perhaps of the key involved, thus making espionage, bribery, burglary, defection, etc., more attractive approaches to the cryptanalytically uninformed. It was finally explicitly recognized in the 19th century that secrecy of a cipher's algorithm is not a sensible nor practical safeguard of message security; in fact, it was further realized that any adequate cryptographic scheme (including ciphers) should remain secure even if the adversary fully understands the cipher algorithm itself. Security of the key used should alone be sufficient for a good cipher to maintain confidentiality under an attack. This fundamental principle was first explicitly stated in 1883 by [Auguste Kerckhoffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Kerckhoffs "Auguste Kerckhoffs") and is generally called [Kerckhoffs's Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerckhoffs%27s_Principle "Kerckhoffs's Principle"); alternatively and more bluntly, it was restated by [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon "Claude Shannon"), the inventor of [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory "Information theory") and the fundamentals of theoretical cryptography, as _Shannon's Maxim_—'the enemy knows the system'.

Different physical devices and aids have been used to assist with ciphers. One of the earliest may have been the scytale of ancient Greece, a rod supposedly used by the Spartans as an aid for a transposition cipher. In medieval times, other aids were invented such as the [cipher grille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grille_\(cryptography\) "Grille (cryptography)"), which was also used for a kind of steganography. With the invention of polyalphabetic ciphers came more sophisticated aids such as Alberti's own [cipher disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher_disk "Cipher disk"), [Johannes Trithemius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Trithemius "Johannes Trithemius")' [tabula recta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabula_recta "Tabula recta") scheme, and [Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson "Thomas Jefferson")'s [wheel cypher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jefferson_disk "Jefferson disk") (not publicly known, and reinvented independently by [Bazeries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bazeries "Bazeries") around 1900). Many mechanical encryption/decryption devices were invented early in the 20th century, and several patented, among them [rotor machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotor_machine "Rotor machine")—famously including the [Enigma machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine "Enigma machine") used by the German government and military from the late 1920s and during [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II").[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography#cite_note-32) The ciphers implemented by better quality examples of these machine designs brought about a substantial increase in cryptanalytic difficulty after WWI.

## Early computer-era cryptography

Cryptanalysis of the new mechanical ciphering devices proved to be both difficult and laborious. In the United Kingdom, cryptanalytic efforts at [Bletchley Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park "Bletchley Park") during WWII spurred the development of more efficient means for carrying out repetitive tasks, such [as military code breaking (decryption)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code-breaking "Code-breaking"). This culminated in the development of the [Colossus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer "Colossus computer"), the world's first fully electronic, digital, [programmable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming") computer, which assisted in the decryption of ciphers generated by the German Army's [Lorenz SZ40/42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_SZ40/42 "Lorenz SZ40/42") machine.

Extensive open academic research into cryptography is relatively recent, beginning in the mid-1970s. In the early 1970s [IBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM "IBM") personnel designed the Data Encryption Standard (DES) algorithm that became the first federal government cryptography standard in the United States. In 1976 [Whitfield Diffie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitfield_Diffie "Whitfield Diffie") and [Martin Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Hellman "Martin Hellman") published the Diffie–Hellman key exchange algorithm. In 1977 the [RSA algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_\(algorithm\) "RSA (algorithm)") was published in [Martin Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner "Martin Gardner")'s _[Scientific American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_American "Scientific American")_ column. Since then, cryptography has become a widely used tool in communications, [computer networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network "Computer network"), and [computer security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security "Computer security") generally.

## Modern Cryptography

[Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon "Claude Shannon")'s two papers, his [1948 paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication "A Mathematical Theory of Communication") on [information theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory "Information theory"), and especially his [1949 paper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_Theory_of_Secrecy_Systems "Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems") on cryptography, laid the foundations of modern cryptography and provided a mathematical basis for future cryptography. His 1949 paper has been noted as having provided a "solid theoretical basis for cryptography and for cryptanalysis" and as having turned cryptography from an "art to a science". As a result of his contributions and work, he has been described as the "founding father of modern cryptography".

Just as the development of digital computers and electronics helped in cryptanalysis, it made possible much more complex ciphers. Furthermore, computers allowed for the encryption of any kind of data representable in any binary format, unlike classical ciphers which only encrypted written language texts; this was new and significant. Computer use has thus supplanted linguistic cryptography, both for cipher design and cryptanalysis. Many computer ciphers can be characterized by their operation on [binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_numeral_system "Binary numeral system") [bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit "Bit") sequences (sometimes in groups or blocks), unlike classical and mechanical schemes, which generally manipulate traditional characters (i.e., letters and digits) directly. However, computers have also assisted cryptanalysis, which has compensated to some extent for increased cipher complexity. Nonetheless, good modern ciphers have stayed ahead of cryptanalysis; it is typically the case that use of a quality cipher is very efficient (i.e., fast and requiring few resources, such as memory or CPU capability), while breaking it requires an effort many orders of magnitude larger, and vastly larger than that required for any classical cipher, making cryptanalysis so inefficient and impractical as to be effectively impossible.

Research into **post-quantum cryptography** (PQC) has intensified because practical quantum computers would break widely deployed public-key systems such as RSA, Diffie–Hellman and ECC. A 2017 review in _Nature_ surveys the leading PQC families—lattice-based, code-based, multivariate-quadratic and hash-based schemes—and stresses that standardisation and deployment should proceed well before large-scale quantum machines become available.

## Symmetric-key cryptography

Symmetric-key cryptography refers to encryption methods in which both the sender and receiver share the same key (or, less commonly, in which their keys are different, but related in an easily computable way). This was the only kind of encryption publicly known until June 1976.
