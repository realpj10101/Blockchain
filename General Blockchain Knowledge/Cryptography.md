**Cryptography**, or **cryptology** (from [Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_language "Ancient Greek language"): [κρυπτός](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%BA%CF%81%CF%85%CF%80%CF%84%CF%8C%CF%82#Ancient_Greek "wikt:κρυπτός"), [romanized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Ancient_Greek "Romanization of Ancient Greek"): _kryptós_ "hidden, secret"; and [γράφειν](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%B3%CF%81%CE%AC%CF%86%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%BD#Ancient_Greek "wikt:γράφειν") _graphein_, "to write", or [-λογία](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/-%CE%BB%CE%BF%CE%B3%CE%AF%CE%B1#Ancient_Greek "wikt:-λογία") _[-logia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-logy "-logy")_, "study", respectively, is the practice and study of techniques for [secure communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_communication "Secure communication") in the presence of [adversarial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversary_\(cryptography\) "Adversary (cryptography)") behavior More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing [protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol "Communication protocol") that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), [information security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security "Information security"), [electrical engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_engineering "Electrical engineering"), [digital signal processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal_processing "Digital signal processing"), physics, and others. Core concepts related to [information security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security "Information security") ([data confidentiality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidentiality "Confidentiality"), [data integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity "Data integrity"), [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication "Authentication"), and [non-repudiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-repudiation "Non-repudiation")) are also central to cryptography. Practical applications of cryptography include [electronic commerce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_commerce "Electronic commerce"), [chip-based payment cards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_card#EMV "Smart card"), [digital currencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currencies "Digital currencies"), [computer passwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password "Password"), and [military communications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_communications "Military communications").

Cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with [encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption "Encryption"), converting readable information ([plaintext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext "Plaintext")) to unintelligible [nonsense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonsense "Nonsense") text ([ciphertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext "Ciphertext")), which can only be read by reversing the process ([decryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decryption "Decryption")). The sender of an encrypted (coded) message shares the decryption (decoding) technique only with the intended recipients to preclude access from adversaries. The cryptography literature [often uses the names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_and_Bob "Alice and Bob") "Alice" (or "A") for the sender, "Bob" (or "B") for the intended recipient, and "Eve" (or "E") for the [eavesdropping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eavesdropping "Eavesdropping") adversary. Since the development of [rotor cipher machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotor_machine "Rotor machine") in [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I") and the advent of computers in [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), cryptography methods have become increasingly complex and their applications more varied.

Modern cryptography is heavily based on [mathematical theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_theory "Mathematical theory") and computer science practice; cryptographic [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") are designed around [computational hardness assumptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_hardness_assumption "Computational hardness assumption"), making such algorithms hard to break in actual practice by any adversary. While it is theoretically possible to break into a well-designed system, it is infeasible in actual practice to do so. Such schemes, if well designed, are therefore termed "computationally secure". Theoretical advances (e.g., improvements in [integer factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization "Integer factorization") algorithms) and faster computing technology require these designs to be continually reevaluated and, if necessary, adapted. [Information-theoretically secure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information-theoretic_security "Information-theoretic security") schemes that provably cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power, such as the [one-time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad "One-time pad"), are much more difficult to use in practice than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure schemes.

The growth of cryptographic technology has raised [a number of legal issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography_law "Cryptography law") in the [Information Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Age "Information Age"). Cryptography's potential for use as a tool for espionage and [sedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedition "Sedition") has led many governments to classify it as a weapon and to limit or even prohibit its use and export. In some jurisdictions where the use of cryptography is legal, laws permit investigators to [compel the disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_disclosure_law "Key disclosure law") of [encryption keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_\(cryptography\) "Key (cryptography)") for documents relevant to an investigation. Cryptography also plays a major role in [digital rights management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management "Digital rights management") and [copyright infringement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_infringement "Copyright infringement") disputes with regard to [digital media](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_media "Digital media").

## Terminology

Until modern times, cryptography referred almost exclusively to "encryption", which is the process of converting ordinary information (called [plaintext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext "Plaintext")) into an unintelligible form (called [ciphertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext "Ciphertext")). Decryption is the reverse, in other words, moving from the unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext. A [cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher "Cipher") (or cypher) is a pair of algorithms that carry out the encryption and the reversing decryption. The detailed operation of a cipher is controlled both by the algorithm and, in each instance, by a "key". The key is a secret (ideally known only to the communicants), usually a string of characters (ideally short so it can be remembered by the user), which is needed to decrypt the ciphertext. In formal mathematical terms, a "[cryptosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptosystem "Cryptosystem")" is the ordered list of elements of finite possible plaintexts, finite possible cyphertexts, finite possible keys, and the encryption and decryption algorithms that correspond to each key. Keys are important both formally and in actual practice, as ciphers without variable keys can be trivially broken with only the knowledge of the cipher used and are therefore useless (or even counter-productive) for most purposes. Historically, ciphers were often used directly for encryption or decryption without additional procedures such as [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authentication "Authentication") or integrity checks.

There are two main types of cryptosystems: [symmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm "Symmetric-key algorithm") and [asymmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography "Public-key cryptography"). In symmetric systems, the only ones known until the 1970s, the same secret key encrypts and decrypts a message. Data manipulation in symmetric systems is significantly faster than in asymmetric systems. Asymmetric systems use a "public key" to encrypt a message and a related "private key" to decrypt it. The advantage of asymmetric systems is that the public key can be freely published, allowing parties to establish secure communication without having a shared secret key. In practice, asymmetric systems are used to first exchange a secret key, and then secure communication proceeds via a more efficient symmetric system using that key.[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography#cite_note-14) Examples of asymmetric systems include [Diffie–Hellman key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange "Diffie–Hellman key exchange"), RSA ([Rivest–Shamir–Adleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_\(cryptosystem\) "RSA (cryptosystem)")), ECC ([Elliptic Curve Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Cryptography "Elliptic Curve Cryptography")), and [Post-quantum cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography "Post-quantum cryptography"). Secure symmetric algorithms include the commonly used AES ([Advanced Encryption Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard "Advanced Encryption Standard")) which replaced the older DES ([Data Encryption Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard "Data Encryption Standard")).[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography#cite_note-15) Insecure symmetric algorithms include children's language tangling schemes such as [Pig Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin "Pig Latin") or other [cant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cant_\(language\) "Cant (language)"), and all historical cryptographic schemes, however seriously intended, prior to the invention of the [one-time pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad "One-time pad") early in the 20th century.

In [colloquial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloquial "Colloquial") use, the term "[code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_\(cryptography\) "Code (cryptography)")" is often used to mean any method of encryption or concealment of meaning. However, in cryptography, code has a more specific meaning: the replacement of a unit of plaintext (i.e., a meaningful word or phrase) with a [code word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_word_\(communication\) "Code word (communication)") (for example, "wallaby" replaces "attack at dawn"). A cypher, in contrast, is a scheme for changing or substituting an element below such a level (a letter, a syllable, or a pair of letters, etc.) to produce a cyphertext.

[Cryptanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis "Cryptanalysis") is the term used for the study of methods for obtaining the meaning of encrypted information without access to the key normally required to do so; i.e., it is the study of how to "crack" encryption algorithms or their implementations.

Some use the terms "cryptography" and "cryptology" interchangeably in English,[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography#cite_note-16) while others (including US military practice generally) use "cryptography" to refer specifically to the use and practice of cryptographic techniques and "cryptology" to refer to the combined study of cryptography and cryptanalysis.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography#cite_note-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography#cite_note-18) English is more flexible than several other languages in which "cryptology" (done by cryptologists) is always used in the second sense above. [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFC_\(identifier\) "RFC (identifier)") [2828](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2828) advises that [steganography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography "Steganography") is sometimes included in cryptology.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography#cite_note-rfc2828-19)

The study of characteristics of languages that have some application in cryptography or cryptology (e.g. frequency data, letter combinations, universal patterns, etc.) is called [cryptolinguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cryptolinguistics&action=edit&redlink=1 "Cryptolinguistics (page does not exist)"). Cryptolingusitics is especially used in military intelligence applications for deciphering foreign communications.[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography#cite_note-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography#cite_note-21)
