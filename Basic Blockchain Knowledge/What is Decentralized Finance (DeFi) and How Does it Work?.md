## What Is Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging peer-to-peer financial system that uses blockchain and cryptocurrencies to allow people, businesses, or other entities to transact directly with each other. The key principle behind DeFi is to remove third parties like banks from the financial system, thereby reducing costs and transaction times.

## How Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Works

Through peer-to-peer financial networks, DeFi uses security protocols, connectivity, software, and hardware advancements. This system eliminates intermediaries like banks and other financial service companies. These companies charge businesses and customers for using their services, which are necessary in the current system because it's the only way to make it work. DeFi uses blockchain technology to reduce the need for these intermediaries.

## Goals of Decentralized Finance

Peer-to-peer (P2P) financial transactions are one of the core premises behind DeFi, where two parties agree to exchange cryptocurrency for goods or services without a third party involved.

- **Accessibility**: Anyone with an internet connection can access a DeFi platform, and transactions occur without geographic restrictions.

- **Low fees and negotiable interest rates**: DeFi enables any two parties to negotiate interest rates directly and lend cryptocurrency or money via DeFi networks.

- **Security and Transparency**: [Smart contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp) published on a blockchain and records of completed transactions are available for anyone to review but do not reveal your identity. Blockchains are generally immutable, meaning they cannot be altered.

- **Autonomy**: DeFi platforms don't rely on [centralized financial institutions](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/030315/what-financial-services-sector.asp). The decentralized nature of DeFi protocols mitigates the need for and costs of administering financial services.


## How to Get Involved in DeFi

Becoming involved in decentralized finance might seem intimidating at first, but there are many ways to do so. The first thing you should do if you want to get into DeFi is to research the activities that interest you the most. You'll need a wallet, but because there are so many to choose from, you'll need to learn more about them and find the one that appeals to you.

Once you identify your wallet and activity, you can find a reputable exchange that provides the activity you want to get involved in or use, buy some cryptocurrency, and get started.
