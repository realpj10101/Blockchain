## What Is Decentralized Finance (DeFi)

Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging peer-to-peer financial system that uses blockchain and cryptocurrencies to allow people, businesses, or other entities to transact directly with each other. The key principle behind DeFi is to remove third parties like banks from the financial system, thereby reducing costs and transaction times.

## How Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Works

Through peer-to-peer financial networks, DeFi uses security protocols, connectivity, software, and hardware advancements. This system eliminates intermediaries like banks and other financial service companies. These companies charge businesses and customers for using their services, which are necessary in the current system because it's the only way to make it work. DeFi uses blockchain technology to reduce the need for these intermediaries.
